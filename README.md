MySurf is a web browser built for speed, simplicity, and security.

PROJECT STATUS: Completed. In Alpha.

Status Updates
=======
3/6/2015- MySurf has upgraded Chromium, using a different way to bind Chromium to MySurf, which should allow for a faster, more stable browsing experience. Because we are using a different way to bind Chromium to MySurf, we are back in Alpha. The good news is that we expect to be out of Alpha and back in Beta very soon. The new source should be uploaded in the next few days.
