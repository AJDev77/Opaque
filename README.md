Status Updates
=======
4/19/2015- MySurf is getting a new name! The new name will not be announced yet, which is why you will not see many changes to this repository. The MySurf application is in the middle of being re-branded, so we don't want to upload anything so that the name does not come out. We just want you to know that MySurf (or the new name) is still under active development!

3/6/2015- MySurf has upgraded Chromium, using a different way to bind Chromium to MySurf, which should allow for a faster, more stable browsing experience. Because we are using a different way to bind Chromium to MySurf, we are back in Alpha. The good news is that we expect to be out of Alpha and back in Beta very soon. The new source should be uploaded in the next few days.
