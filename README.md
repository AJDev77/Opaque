PROJECT STATUS: Completed. In Alpha.

Update 9/14/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is out now! View the code above, or go to http://mysurf.tk/download to download an already built package.

Update 8/20/14: MySurf had a sudden change to its browsing engine. Instead of using Awesomium (based on Chrome 18), MySurf will be using a CEF3 wrapper for .Net (based on Chrome 31). This will enable MySurf 3.0 Beta users to have a more enjoyable web experience. Public Beta 1 will be delayed until we get the new CEF3 wrapper working and tested. We may switch back to Awesomium at a later date (when they get past Chrome 31).

Update 9/7/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is going to be released in the next few days. Just a reminder, alpha releases are very unstable, and could cause your system to crash, data loss, etc. The maximum result we had happen was a application crash. If you decide to download, please report all bugs you find.
