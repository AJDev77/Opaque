MySurf web browser.


PROJECT STATUS: Completed. In Beta.

Update 11/26/14: MySurf Beta 1 is now out! This update includes bug fixes and added features. To update: Go on MySurf, click the "settings" icon in the top-right corner, click the "i", click "Check for updates", follow prompts. You can also download the new update package from http://mysurf.tk/download and install over your current version.

Update 11/1/14: Since MySurf Auto Login will be coming out within the next week, a note about the security: MySurf Auto Login is not a magic bullet. Even though MySurf Auto Login provides useful encryption for your password, you should never trust any piece of software with your life, and MySurf is no exception.

Update 9/23/14: MySurf will most likely remain in Alpha until we can view the details of the new Awesomium branch. According to Awesomium Dev Adam Simmons, Awesomium “switched over to latest Blink/WebKit trunk last year and are conducting a massive overhaul of the rendering architecture” and “more details will be announced soon”. Hopefully they can get up to the latest WebKit trunk, from this year, soon.

Update 9/14/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is out now! View the code above, or go to http://mysurf.tk/download to download an already built package.

Update 8/20/14: MySurf had a sudden change to its browsing engine. Instead of using Awesomium (based on Chrome 18), MySurf will be using a CEF3 wrapper for .Net (based on Chrome 31). This will enable MySurf 3.0 Beta users to have a more enjoyable web experience. Public Beta 1 will be delayed until we get the new CEF3 wrapper working and tested. We may switch back to Awesomium at a later date (when they get past Chrome 31).

Update 9/7/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is going to be released in the next few days. Just a reminder, alpha releases are very unstable, and could cause your system to crash, data loss, etc. The maximum result we had happen was a application crash. If you decide to download, please report all bugs you find.
