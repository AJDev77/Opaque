MySurf
======

MySurf web browser.


PROJECT STATUS: Completed. Undergoing updates. 

Update 8/20/14: MySurf had a sudden change to its browsing engine. Instead of using Awesomium (based on Chrome 18), MySurf will be using a CEF3 wrapper for .Net (based on Chrome 31). This will enable MySurf 3.0 Beta users to have a more enjoyable web experience. Public Beta 1 will be delayed until we get the new CEF3 wrapper working and tested. We may switch back to Awesomium at a later date (when they get past Chrome 31).

Update 8/18/14: MySurf 3.0 Public Beta 1 should be coming out very soon. MySurf may be in beta for longer than expected while all of the bugs are worked out.
