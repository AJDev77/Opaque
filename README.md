MySurf web browser.


PROJECT STATUS: Completed. In Alpha.

BUILD STATUS: ![](http://mysurf.tk/buildstatusfail.png)

Update 11/1/14: Since MySurf Auto Login will be coming out within the next week, a note about the security: MySurf Auto Login is not a magic bullet. Even though MySurf Auto Login provides useful encryption for your password, you should never trust any piece of software with your life, and MySurf is no exception.

Update 10/30/14: MySurf licensed under Emposoft open source license. See license file for more information. 

Update 9/23/14: MySurf will most likely remain in Alpha until we can view the details of the new Awesomium branch. According to Awesomium Dev Adam Simmons, Awesomium “switched over to latest Blink/WebKit trunk last year and are conducting a massive overhaul of the rendering architecture” and “more details will be announced soon”. Hopefully they can get up to the latest WebKit trunk, from this year, soon.

Update 9/14/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is out now! View the code above, or go to http://mysurf.tk/download to download an already built package.

Update 8/20/14: MySurf had a sudden change to its browsing engine. Instead of using Awesomium (based on Chrome 18), MySurf will be using a CEF3 wrapper for .Net (based on Chrome 31). This will enable MySurf 3.0 Beta users to have a more enjoyable web experience. Public Beta 1 will be delayed until we get the new CEF3 wrapper working and tested. We may switch back to Awesomium at a later date (when they get past Chrome 31).

Update 9/7/14: MySurf 3.0 Alpha 1 is going to be released in the next few days. Just a reminder, alpha releases are very unstable, and could cause your system to crash, data loss, etc. The maximum result we had happen was a application crash. If you decide to download, please report all bugs you find.
