v1.1-

•  New and improved download manager
      o	Includes a new look and more features
      o	It continues to update you on the progress
      o	New cancel button
      o	Adds our own file extention to it (while downloading),
	to prevent you from opening it before it finishes.

•  Added a Do Not Track (DNT) request in the header
      o	This tells websites that you don't want to be
	tracked. Websites don't always follow this though,
	which is why we are working on more features that
	will force websites to follow it by blocking all
	trackers.
